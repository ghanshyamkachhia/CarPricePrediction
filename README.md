# CarPricePrediction

The project collects data on used car prices, company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
The data is cleaned and engineered to create features that are predictive of car price.
A machine learning model is selected to predict car prices.
The model is trained on the dataset.
The model is deployed on Flask, which is a web framework that makes it easy to create and deploy web applications.
The project can be used by car buyers, sellers, dealerships, and insurance companies to get an idea of the fair market value of a used car. It can also be used to set a competitive price for a used car, price used cars at dealerships, and assess the value of a used car for insurance purposes.
